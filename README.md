# TSDT14

Labs for the TSDT14 Signal Theory course for master students given in Link√∂ping University by Mikael Olofsson, 2017-2018.

The goal of these laborations in signal theory is to create, manage and analyze outcomes of stochastic processes using a computer. The laborations is divided into four studies:

* Modelling signals
* Improving spectrum estimates
* Non-LTI-systems
* Special operations

Everything is done using Matlab, and the functions have been self-defined since it's not allowed to use built-in MatLab functions.

### Contents:

* MatLab manual (provided by the teacher)
* Lab Memo (provided by the teacher)
* Code for every study
* Additional funtions used in MatLab
* Report PDF
* Report LaTex code
* Figures obtained with the code

_If you are going to use this code, be careful with the path given for saving the images, since it will be different in every computer. Also, be aware that plagiarism is forbiden and punished by the university._
